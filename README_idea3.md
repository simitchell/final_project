TERCIARY IDEA
Use AI to construct a personalized fitness plan based on weight loss goals, strength training, and cardio.

Input fields
        - timeline
        - weight loss/gain goals
        - primary type of training (strength, cardio, body weight, crossfit type)

Feed these to AI, ask for a workout plan for the next [timeframe]
        - also ask for protein intake
        - caloric intake

Maybe creating AUTH_USERS is required?  Maybe it's not?  I dunno.  

Maybe have a way to connect someone with a real life personal trainer for a 30m video call.
